Python Portfolio Projects  
This folder contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects I completed while studying with Analyst Builder’s Python for Beginners course. I added custom logic and structure to each one as I gained confidence.

These projects showcase core Python fundamentals like file manipulation, automation, web scraping, loops, functions, conditionals, and working with libraries like pandas, re, and BeautifulSoup.

Projects  
0. Dynamic Parole Recommendation Simulator  
Simulates parole recommendation outcomes based on static versus dynamic factors, including age, sentence length, program participation, disciplinary actions, and visitation.  
Uses pandas and matplotlib to model how eligibility changes with more behaviorally informed criteria.  
Built in response to a Recidiviz job listing to demonstrate policy modeling and analysis with real-world application.

1. Automated Web Scraper  
Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate pulling Bitcoin prices from CoinMarketCap  
Scrapes the rendered price, parses the HTML, and stores results in a pandas DataFrame

2. Automatic File Sorter  
Script that automatically organizes files into folders based on file type  
Uses os, shutil, and control flow to check file extensions and move them to appropriate directories

3. Calculator  
Simple calculator built with Python functions and input validation  
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with error handling

4. Unit of Measurement Converter  
Converts values between imperial and metric units (e.g., inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms)  
Includes a custom menu interface and while loop logic for continued conversion

5. Web Scraping with Regex and Pandas  
Scrapes Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech from a website  
Cleans the text, applies regex logic, and analyzes word frequency using pandas

Purpose  
Each project was a step in my Python learning journey. These files represent not just skill-building exercises but also a growing ability to solve real-world tasks with code. You can find my full portfolio at jrwportfolio.com.
