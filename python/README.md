# Python Portfolio Projects

This folder contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects I completed while studying with Analyst Builder’s Python for Beginners course and through independent practice.  

I added custom logic and structure to each project as I gained confidence, focusing on clear code organization and professional presentation.

These projects showcase core Python fundamentals including file manipulation, automation, web scraping, text processing, simulation, loops, functions, conditionals, and working with libraries such as pandas, re, matplotlib, and BeautifulSoup.

## Projects

### Dynamic Parole Recommendation Simulator  
Simulates parole recommendation outcomes based on static versus dynamic factors, including age, sentence length, program participation, disciplinary actions, and family visitation.  
Uses pandas and matplotlib to model how eligibility changes with more behaviorally informed criteria.  
Built in response to a Recidiviz job listing to demonstrate policy modeling and analysis with real-world application.

### Automated Web Scraper: Live Bitcoin Price Tracker  
Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape live Bitcoin prices from CoinMarketCap.  
Scrapes the rendered price, parses the HTML, and stores results in a pandas DataFrame and CSV file.  
Tracks and reports the total price change across a short scraping window.

### Automatic File Sorter  
Script that automatically organizes files into subfolders based on file type.  
Uses os, shutil, and control flow to scan a folder and sort files by extension.  
This version demonstrates the logic with a demo folder and dummy files to preserve privacy.

### Calculator  
Simple console-based calculator built with Python functions and input handling.  
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an interactive menu.

### Unit of Measurement Converter  
Converts values between inches, feet, and yards through a console-based interface.  
Supports float inputs and multiple variations of unit names (e.g., "inches", "inch", "in").  
Includes custom input validation for a more flexible user experience.

### Web Scraping and Text Cleaning: MLK Jr. "I Have a Dream" Speech  
Scrapes Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech from a sample webpage.  
Cleans and tokenizes the text using regular expressions, then analyzes word frequency with pandas.  
Demonstrates beginner natural language processing (NLP) techniques and text analysis workflow.

## Purpose

Each project represents a step in my Python learning journey and an opportunity to apply core concepts to real-world scenarios.  

Beyond skill-building exercises, these projects reflect my growing ability to design solutions, handle edge cases, and present code professionally.
