# Python Portfolio Projects

This folder contains a collection of hands-on Python projects built using Jupyter Notebooks as part of my learning journey in data analytics and automation, learning from the Analyst Builder platform. Each project applies core Python skills to solve real-world problems or automate common tasks.

## Projects

### Project: Automated Web Scraper
Uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to extract cryptocurrency pricing data from a live website and store it in a DataFrame for analysis.

### Project: Automatic File Sorter
Sorts files from a target directory into subfolders based on file type (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.xlsx`) using `os`, `shutil`, and custom logic.

### Project: Calculator
A basic command-line calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using input validation and user-friendly design.

### Project: Unit of Measurement Converter
Converts between common units (temperature, length, weight, etc.) using custom conversion functions and a clean user prompt interface.

### Project: Web Scraping + Regex + Pandas
Scrapes data from a test website using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, then applies `re` (regex) and `pandas` to clean, transform, and analyze the data.

These projects reflect my foundational understanding of Python syntax, scripting, file handling, web scraping, and data manipulation.

Each project can be opened using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
