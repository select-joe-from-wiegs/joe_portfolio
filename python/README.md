# Python Portfolio Projects

This folder contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects I completed while studying with Analyst Builder‚Äôs Python for Beginners course. I added custom logic and structure to each one as I gained confidence.

These projects showcase core Python fundamentals like file manipulation, automation, web scraping, loops, functions, conditionals, and working with libraries like `pandas`, `re`, and `BeautifulSoup`.

## üîß Projects

### 1. **Automated Web Scraper**
- Uses `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` to automate pulling Bitcoin prices from CoinMarketCap
- Scrapes the rendered price, parses the HTML, and stores results in a pandas DataFrame

### 2. **Automatic File Sorter**
- Script that automatically organizes files into folders based on file type
- Uses `os`, `shutil`, and control flow to check file extensions and move them to appropriate directories

### 3. **Calculator**
- Simple calculator built with Python functions and input validation
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with error handling

### 4. **Unit of Measurement Converter**
- Converts values between imperial and metric units (e.g., inches to centimeters, pounds to kilograms)
- Includes a custom menu interface and `while` loop logic for continued conversion

### 5. **Web Scraping with Regex and Pandas**
- Scrapes Dr. King‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech from a website
- Cleans the text, applies regex logic, and analyzes word frequency using `pandas`

## üìÅ Purpose

Each project was a step in my Python learning journey. These files represent not just skill-building exercises but also a growing ability to solve real-world tasks with code. You can find my full portfolio at [jrwportfolio.com](https://www.jrwportfolio.com).
