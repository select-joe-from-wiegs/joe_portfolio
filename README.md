# Joe's Data Portfolio

Welcome to my personal data portfolio repository! I'm Joe Wiegert — a Patient Case Auditor by day and a curious, self-taught Data Analyst by night. This repo contains the code, notebooks, and documentation behind the projects featured on my portfolio website: [www.jrwportfolio.com](https://www.jrwportfolio.com)

Over the past several months, I’ve been building hands-on skills in **Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau** — tackling real-world challenges and creating interactive tools, dashboards, and simulations along the way.

## Project Categories

### Python Projects
This section contains beginner-to-intermediate Python projects focused on automation, data processing, and practical utilities. All projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks:

- **[Automated Web Scraper](python/Project_Automated_Web_Scraper.ipynb)** — Automatically scrapes web data for analysis.
- **[Automatic File Sorter](python/Project_Automatic_File_Sorter.ipynb)** — Organizes files into folders based on file type.
- **[Calculator](python/Project_Calculator.ipynb)** — Basic calculator implemented with Python logic.
- **[Dynamic Parole Recommendation Simulator](python/Project_Dynamic-Parole-Recommendation-Simulator.ipynb)** — Simulates dynamic parole case recommendations using weighted variables.
- **[Unit of Measurement Converter](python/Project_Unit_of_Measurement_Converter.ipynb)** — Converts values between common units.
- **[Web Scraping with Regex & Pandas](python/Project_Web_Scraping_Regex_Pandas.ipynb)** — Advanced web scraping and text parsing using Regex and Pandas.

### SQL Projects
Portfolio-quality analyses using MySQL, built from the ground up with realistic, synthetic datasets:

- **Polling Analyst Project** — Public trust in political information during the AI era.
- **Campaign Data Project** — Exploring which factors best predict election outcomes.

Each project includes:
- Clean schema design.
- Complex joins, CTEs, and aggregations.
- Analytical insights and summary visuals.

### Excel Projects
Interactive dashboards and logic-based tools created using Excel’s full power:

- **Coffee Orders Dashboard** — Features dynamic visuals, pivot tables, and formulas like `INDEX-MATCH`.

### Tableau Projects
Visual storytelling with interactive dashboards published to Tableau Public:

- **British Airways Reviews Analysis** — Uncovering insights in customer feedback with heat maps and calculated fields.

## About Me
With a background in engineering and real-world auditing experience, I bring precision and curiosity to everything I build. My goal is to transition into a full-time **Data Analyst** role where I can use these skills to drive insight, solve problems, and support mission-driven teams.
