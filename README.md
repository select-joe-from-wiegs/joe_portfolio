# Joe's Data Portfolio

Welcome to my personal data portfolio repository! I'm Joe Wiegert — a Patient Case Auditor by day and a curious, self-taught Data Analyst by night. This repo contains the code, notebooks, and documentation behind the projects featured on my portfolio website: [www.jrwportfolio.com](https://www.jrwportfolio.com)

Over the past several months, I’ve been building hands-on skills in **Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau** — tackling real-world challenges and creating interactive tools, dashboards, and simulations along the way.

## Project Categories

### Python Projects
These beginner-to-intermediate projects focus on automation, data processing, and user-facing tools:
- Mood Logger (GUI app with CSV tracking)
- Tone Rewriter (OpenAI-powered Tkinter app)
- File Sorter & Unit Converter utilities
- Web scrapers using BeautifulSoup, Regex, and Pandas

---

### SQL Projects
Portfolio-quality analyses using MySQL, built from the ground up with realistic, synthetic datasets:
- **Polling Analyst Project**: Public trust in political information during the AI era
- **Campaign Data Project**: Exploring which factors best predict election outcomes

Each project includes:
- Clean schema design
- Complex joins, CTEs, and aggregations
- Analytical insights and summary visuals

---

### Excel Projects
Interactive dashboards and logic-based tools created using Excel’s full power:
- Coffee Orders Dashboard — featuring dynamic visuals, pivot tables, and formulas like `INDEX-MATCH`

---

### Tableau Projects
Visual storytelling with interactive dashboards published to Tableau Public:
- British Airways Reviews Analysis — uncovering insights in customer feedback with heat maps and calculated fields

---

## About Me
With a background in engineering and real-world auditing experience, I bring precision and curiosity to everything I build. My goal is to transition into a full-time **Data Analyst** role where I can use these skills to drive insight, solve problems, and support mission-driven teams.
